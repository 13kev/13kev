### Sailing through an open sea of opportunities and knowledge, being filled with determination by the possibilty of finding great treasures while having fun in the journey. 

Heya! I'm Kevin, 24yo newbie in developing field, with passion for anything related to technology, art, music and videogames (which I think is the perfect place to find all of those things merged together). I come from a technical background in computer maintanence so I have a thing about hardware too. 

Currently learning front-end and looking to get the opportunity to contribute to exciting projects while doing so!
